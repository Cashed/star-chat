Star Chat
=========

Star Chat is a web app for those who find that sometimes the only way to truly express themselves is with an appropriate Star Trek picture.  This app attempts to transport the user into a total Star Trek communication experience.  

Users choose unique names upon login and are assigned a random profile picture of a Star Trek character.  Users may enter and send text and/or a picture from one of the three emoticon buttons.   

Online member names are populated on the console to the left.  Profile pages for users may be accessed by clicking on these user names.

The Tech

Of course, due to the inspiring nature of the Star Trek series, Star Chat is in the works of implementing even more features such as:

+ Customizable profile pages (RESOLVED! 3/14)
+ User accounts
+ Private whispers

Please, stay tuned!
